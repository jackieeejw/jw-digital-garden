Oh, these fog filled foothills, our ebbing vale of tears
At dusk I call to you
After twelve laborious hours,
Survey your ashen landscapes full
Of harsh meadows, marsh
Mallow and
A flock of dusks,

Where expectant mothers weave egg sacs
For their fledgling six legged young
Then sputter out on aluminium shores
As lamp-drunk moths dance
The fleeting rites of summer.

At midnight I sweep through the rustling cicada thrush 
of pitch-black pitch-pine punch-drunk,
And feel the cool, damp soil in the inky vastness of the non-human night,
Dream of the land’s tempests floods and fires–
Dim amber barn-burnt smoke rising from the hills at first moonlight.

There, at the end of days,
In this strange, unnatural fantasy
Of living once at one with the world,
I learn the meaning of the words prairie and forest,
Beyond the simple gifts I dreamt of as a child.

Down past the thrush and onto the gravel floodlit drive,
That cuts through the thousand-fold twenty-foot new-growths,
I make my way to you in your too-damp log cabin 
where you weep in the mornings,
And find some small shelter from the violence of these hills.

And I hold you.

I have made the needle-floored damp my home,
Laid roots in the earth where I was once 
a simple passer-by, if only for a little while.
And although I may never learn to call back to the loons or wake
Early enough to watch the amber warning of daybreak
Dance upon this vast green mountain estate.
I have come to know some small part of the glowbugs and the gorges,
This world that, with or without us,
Howls, croaks, sings back,
And will be there always to greet us in the morning.
